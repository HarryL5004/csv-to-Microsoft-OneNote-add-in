# Csv-to-Microsoft-OneNote-add-in

## Purpose
Create Microsoft OneNote pages for each record in a csv file automatically with a simple Microsoft Office add-in. Modifications are made on top of the starter project.

This is the repository that contains the source code used in [my guide](https://harrytleung.com/creating_a_OneNote_add-in/).
